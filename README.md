## GROUP 10 for COMP-490-AB1 - Network Security & Cryptography

## Project Members:
# Jasan Brar (1), Mihir Badhan (2), Yuvraj Singh (3).

##  Project Proposal:
# Based off the use of RSA encryption hand-in-hand with digital signatures, such as text of someone's initials, even in the most bare bones degree.

## Implementation and Utilization: 
# Using RSA encryption to encrypt keys and then recognizing a message from a user that should match an initial format, 'First Name', 'Last Name', restricted to 32 characters maximum each, and then encrypt such and then decrypt such to ensure that it was properly done.
